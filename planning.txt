Kalshi Fee Structure:

 Maker Fee Formula:
 0.0175 * P * (1 - P)

 Taker Fee Formula:
 0.07 * P * (1 - P)

 NASDAQ / S&P 500 Fee Structure
 0.035 * P * (1 - P)

 - Taker Fees are 4x higher than Maker Fees
 - Fees increase as % of contract price as contract price decreases
  
 - @ 50% Taker fees are 7% round trip
 - (Peak at 7% each way for 0.01c contracts and are 0.07% for 0.99c contracts)

 - Fees are rounded up to nearest cent so buying in optimal blocks can be important
     - (i.e. buying a single 99c contract has a 1c fee netting 0c if contract expires at $1)
