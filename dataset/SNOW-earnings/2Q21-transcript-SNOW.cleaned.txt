Frank Slootman Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Thanks, Jimmy. Good afternoon everybody. We saw continued momentum in Q2 with 103% year-on-year growth to $255 million in product revenues reflecting strength in Snowflake consumption. Remaining performance obligations grew to $1.5 billion indicating strengthened sales. For the first half of fiscal 2022, total revenues were $501 million, up 107% year-on-year. 3 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 As the net revenue retention rate reached 169%, we also saw non-GAAP product gross margin and operating margin efficiency improve to 73.6% and negative 8%, respectively. Adjusted free cash flow was positive for the third quarter in a row. As we approach the $1 billion mark in annual revenues, we continue to add customers at a robust pace, adding 458 net new customers up from 397 in Q2 of last year. With a focus on the largest organizations, our Fortune 500 count totaled 212 increasing by 18 in the quarter. We are addressing the largest enterprises globally with a vertical industry approach. We see these investments yield strong results. In Q2, financial services customer product revenue grew more than 100% year-on-year representing the largest contribution while healthcare customer product revenue grew nearly 200%. We have engaged in chartered industry events for these verticals and will continue to go to market with tailored business outcomes. We are pleased with our geographical expansion outside the United States, the product revenue from EMEA and Asia Pacific outstripping the company's growth as a whole, growing 185% and 170% year-on-year, respectively. One of our largest new customers signed in the quarter came from Asia Pacific. During Q2, we had key enterprise wins, including AllianceBernstein, Constellation Brands and Lithia Motors. The following milestones we think are worthy of note. In Q2 we announced public preview availability in all [ph] AWS (04:38) regions of Snowpark, our new developer experience. Snowpark enables developers to work in their preferred programming language and formats, including Java and Scala. Snowpark is designed to make building complex data pipelines and applications easy and allow developers to interact with Snowflake directly without having to extract data, maximizing governance. The Snowpark Accelerated Program has over 50 partners enrolled to bring their capabilities and innovations across data science, data engineering and security to Snowpark. In the future Snowpark will have support from Python, and expand to Azure and Google Cloud regions. Python is the most widely used programming language for machine learning and data science generally. We also launched Powered by Snowflake in June to help companies build, operate and grow applications in the Data Cloud. Powered by Snowflake is designed to accelerate the delivery of differentiated applications on Snowflake by supporting developers across all stages of the application journey in Snowflake's Data Cloud. Today there are over 80 Powered by partners, including founding members Blackrock, Adobe, Lacework, Observe and OppLoans. Increasingly application providers are enabling their apps to operate directly against their customers' Snowflake accounts, meaning no data needs to be copied or replicated simplifying data governance while accelerating the network effect of the Data Cloud. We also continued to deliver new capabilities to strengthen data governance for our customers. During the quarter, we made row access policies generally available. Data governance features are typically the broadest and fastest adoptive feature across our customer base. Snowflake's increasing focus on vertical industries is leading to more deeper discussions with customers globally. The Snowflake team is organized around the following core verticals. They are financial services, healthcare and life sciences, retail and CPG, advertising, media and entertainment, technology, public sector, education and manufacturing. This vertical industry focus will continue to intensify and expand over time. One example of our vertical approach is the advertising industry, which is facing new regulations and increasing pressure to strengthen consumer privacy. Advertisers want to compete in a market dominated by the walled 4 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 gardens. The Snowflake Data Cloud is empowering large media companies, technology providers and marketers to collaborate with their data assets across the ecosystem. Snowflake's Data Clean Room solutions can enable companies to share and join data without copying or moving their data assets. Snowflake's Data Cloud powers these Data Clean Rooms with transparency and privacy controls for customers like Disney and NBCUniversal. Each customer is creating their own data network within the Snowflake Data Cloud for their advertising businesses. Snowflake continues to deliver performance and optimization improvements throughout our platform from improving storage efficiencies, lowering ingestion latencies to faster [ph] query (07:51) performance across different workloads. Performance improvements bring not only timelier insights, but improve the economics of our platform for our customers. Finally Data Cloud adoption is growing rapidly, for Data Cloud is the sum of all data networking relationships that are active at any point in time. We track these data relationships through what we call edges. We added over 450 customers in the quarter and continue to expand a number of customers with stable edges. At the end of the quarter, 16% of our customers had stabilized edges in place with external Snowflake accounts compared to 15% last quarter. The total number of these stable edges grew more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. This growth is fueled by the content on our marketplace which saw listings grow 32% quarter-over-quarter. The Data Cloud enables our customers to enrich their data, gain more effective analytical insight and do so faster and more cost effectively. Strategically Snowflake is emerging as a highly secure, compliant, global and efficient data networking infrastructure across the major public cloud domains. The combination of world class data workload execution with cloud application development across cloud operations, data and data application marketplaces, as well as planned monetization is what makes Snowflake standout. During the quarter we hosted our Annual Snowflake Summit to share our Data Cloud strategy, platform optimization, feature enhancements and vertical industry use cases. Over 60,000 folks registered for the three- day event. We had four industry executive sessions and more than 60 customer sessions. Snowflake was launched in preview with over 50 partners supporting the Snowpark Accelerated Program, and we announced Overlay Analytics as the winner of the first Snowflake Startup Challenge. In Q3, we will be hosting events, including the Snowflake Financial Services Data Summit across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. There, we'll be sharing more on how Snowflake is connecting the entire financial services ecosystem. Snowflake is a sponsor at [ph] AdWeek (10:00), where we will discuss our enhanced advertising media and entertainment offerings. And finally Snowflake is holding our BUILD event for technical executives including CTOs, VPs of Engineering, data scientists, data engineers and application developers. In closing, our results demonstrate high-quality, durable growth coupled with improving efficiency and we look forward to executing the second half of the year. With that I will now turn the call over to Mike. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. 5 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 Thank you, Frank. We saw continued strength across the board in Q2 with great sales execution and operational efficiencies setting us up for a strong back half of the year. Our Q2 product revenues were $255 million representing 103% year-over-year growth. Consumption outperformance was led by our financial services customers with continued strength from our technology and healthcare verticals. A rapid growth is driven by our existing customer base. The expansion of our net revenue retention rate to 169% is indicative of the power of our product over time as well as our sales team driving long-term business outcomes. Q2 was an impressive quarter of sales execution. The remaining performance obligations grew to $1.529 billion with net new bookings led by the technology and financial services verticals. We are still maturing the sales organization to sell multiyear contracts. The timing of the largest multiyear deals will be lumpy. As a reminder in Q2 last year, we sold our largest multiyear contract ever a three-year $100 million deal. While the multiyear component of new bookings sets up a difficult comparison, we saw new annualized contract value accelerate compared to the year ago period. This is why RPO and revenue must be evaluated together in a consumption-based business model. Of the $1.5 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 56% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months representing approximately $87 million increase quarter-over-quarter. We remain focused on penetrating the largest enterprises globally as we believe these organizations provide the largest opportunity for account expansion. In Q2, the number of customers with greater than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased to 116 up from 104 last quarter. The second quarter was a breakout quarter for us in terms of profitability and efficiency. On a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 73.6% up 140 basis points from last quarter. Increased price per credit relates to higher priced addition consumption and higher-than-expected compute as a percentage of revenue from improved storage compression mentioned last quarter drove the out performance. We have confidence in our ability to show leverage over time, but we view this significant quarter over quarter increase as one time in nature. Operating margin was negative 8% benefiting from revenue outperformance. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 1% positively impacted by strong linearity in bookings and operating margin outperformance. Going forward, we believe we will remain adjusted free cash flow positive. As a reminder adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of net cash paid or received on both employee and employer payroll taxes related items on employee stock transactions. This quarter we saw a $15 million impact from those items. We maintained a strong cash position with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Now let's turn to our guidance and outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $280 million to $285 million representing year-over-year growth between 89% and 92%. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis a negative 7% operating margin and we expected 303 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $1.06 billion and $1.07 billion representing year-over-year growth between 91% and 93%. Turning to profitability for the full year, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, 73% product gross margins, negative 9% operating margin and 7% adjusted free cash flow margin and we expect 300 million weighted average shares outstanding. 6 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 Our outlook assumes that we will still add more than 1200 net new employees during the fiscal year. With respect to COVID, our forecast now assumes that we will most likely continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future and we have paused most travel with a slight uptick of return to office expenses in the fourth quarter. While we anticipate an eventual return to the office, we do not have a specific timeline for that goal. With that operator you can now open up the line for questions. As a reminder, Christian Kleinerman, our SVP of Product will be joining us for the Q&A. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION Operator: [Operator Instructions] . Your first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Mark R. Murphy Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. I don't have an exact authoritative number to report back to you, but I can tell you that I am involved in those conversations on a daily basis. We lead with that value proposition literally in every conversation. We're batting 1000 when we go down the Data Cloud path. So, we're super excited by the way this is resonating with our future customers. Now, that said the way our market has historically worked, people have had a workload attitude and mentality to the world in terms of moving to the cloud. So, sometimes the Data Cloud is viewed as something that is sort of phase 2 or phase 3. People are first preoccupied with moving data to the cloud, then moving [ph] workloads (17:07) to the cloud and then having [indiscernible] (17:09) up and having a look at what's next. We're working very hard to make sure that we look at the Data Cloud right from beginning and the real reason is what you don't want to do, and this is what we tell every single customer that we meet with, is to recreate the silos of the past in the cloud because of the exact same set of challenges that they have today. So the Data Cloud conversation has to happen upfront to prevent people from re-silo-ing their data and really selling themselves short on the potential of data sciences, machine learning and all the advanced analytics capabilities that are coming down the pike. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Mark R. Murphy Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. I am not really given that, it's been running in the low to mid-50s and as I said we expect 56% based on what we're seeing today. That could change and it really changes based upon how many multiyear deals we do because obviously when the total RPO grows because of multiyear, that percentage could come down, what we're seeing now is 56% we're estimating. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Mark R. Murphy Q Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Gregg Moskowitz Q Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Okay. Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on a good quarter. Frank, you called out strength in financial services and then just wondering when you look at consumption patterns, is there anything that you notice that sort of stood out on a geo basis this quarter? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. On a geo basis, I think we're sort of experiencing traditional patterns in enterprise software adoptions, US leading, EMEA following and after that Asia Pacific. We're actually really encouraged by the uptick in EMEA. We certainly have work to do coming into the company in terms of how were approaching the marketplace. It's coming around really well, very pleased in what's going on in Asia Pacific as well. We're really big on making sure that all our products, all our regions, all our channels are showing up every single quarter and that's really a key focus when you're driving high growth the way we have been. So, everybody is contributing and if there's a secret sauce, that's part of it. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Gregg Moskowitz Q Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC All right, that's very helpful. And then just for Mike, so you've now signed up more than 10% of the Fortune 500 over just the last 12 months, that's incredibly difficult to do. And my question here is given the nature of your model, would it be fair to say that a very small percentage of your Q2 revenue came from these 54 relatively new Fortune 500 customers? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. I would say less than 1% has come from new customers we landed in the quarter and for the full year less than 10% will be for customers we land in the year. As a reminder, and when we land these customers, it takes 9 to 12 months before they really start consuming at a rate. So, what's really driving the revenue this year are all of the customers we landed – those large customers we landed last year. 8 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 And I want to stress, too, it's not just the large – we have a lot of small customers that drive a lot of revenue, too. It's just the point is those large customers, they have a lot of growth potential within them still today. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Gregg Moskowitz Q Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Absolutely. All right, Mike. Thanks. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Stewart Kirk Materne III Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. So, it's done a couple of ways. It's done through our professional service people and we probably do I think less than 10% of [indiscernible] (22:04), but we have a whole alliances program that's focused on all the global geo size and the regional partners and I think the number of those partners including geo size is up 3x from where it was last year and you can see one of the things on our professional service line, a big chunk of that is training, and we are spending a lot of time training partners, so their people can get certified doing a lot of train the trainers, so they can add more resources that are Snowflake certified to do these migrations and implementations. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Stewart Kirk Materne III Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. Actually great question because ironically and this wasn't true in the previous company that you referenced. Public sector is actually the slowest market for Snowflake to come along in Asia Pacific traditionally, especially Japan, tend to be the slow adaptors. They're actually coming around much faster and public sector is actually slower and one of the reasons is cloud adoption in the federal government is bloody hard because of the standards that they have for companies like ours and we can't go on-premise, something that we did do at ServiceNow as you recall. 9 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 We are now getting close to approaching the requirements for broadly being able to contest federal business. We believe that federal business can become 15% of our total number. So there is an enormous opportunity pending for us there. But we have not really effectively addressed it up to this point, but we are super confident that we are going to. There is a lot of tremendous demand there, and it's a very much a procedural set of requirements that we have to grind through and it's not easy to do. So once it's there, it will also really form quite a moat or a barrier, if you will, around that type of cloud business. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Stewart Kirk Materne III Q Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brent A. Bracelin Q Senior Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc. Yes, certainly, Christian here. I think the breadth of the platform that we are presenting to our customers, not only performance advantages relative to alternatives, but the economic benefit that our performance represents, we hear that consistently that has driven migrations from a variety of platforms. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brent A. Bracelin Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. Well the gross profit is driving part of that, the revenue outperformance and also improved gross margins. As we said, we improved 150 basis points. We're really looking more to keep our sales productivity flat and improve that because if it's growing too fast it means we're not adding reps at a fast enough pace out there. And it's really partly because of COVID with the return to office. We're not traveling that we saw some uptick in and our hiring was more backend loaded. And as most of you know, we tend to be very cost conscious when we spend money on anything and I don't think there's a lot of waste in our numbers. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brent A. Bracelin Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Right. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Gray Powell Q Analyst, BTIG LLC Great. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the strong results. Maybe a high-level question on my side, I guess what do you see as the bigger driver of your business today, is the replacement of legacy data warehouse architectures or is it more net new from modern companies like Instacart and Coinbase that start out and build businesses on top of Snowflakes? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. It's Frank. It's actually an important question to ask because we have very high net revenue retention rates and people are often wondering where's that coming from because that's typically not seen. The reason is a lot of what Snowflake does is what we call enabling the demand, in other words, we're not creating it, we're allowing it to happen. So, there is a lot of latent bottled-up pent-up demand that's literally grown over literally decades where people have – because of fixed capacity limits on storage, on computational, architectural limitations, they had not been able to do what the technology is now capable of doing. So, just unlocking that puzzle and allowing workloads to be provisioned, allow unlimited number of concurrent workloads, let jobs run every night as opposed to once a month if you're lucky. That is really the explosion and the enablement of demand that was already there is really the big, big driver behind Snowflake. Now, there are others. I mean there's a brand new use cases that are exploding in several of these verticals that are I think a lot of demand as well. This is a very dynamic marketplace. This is not, okay, we have an existing workload, we're going to move in to the cloud and call it a day. That is not the nature of this business. This is a very fluid, dynamic process where are people are doing brand new innovative things. The great thing about the public cloud combined with Snowflake is that technology is no longer standing in the way. What is only standing in the way now, is your imagination and your budget. Those are not minor things by the way, but that's a whole of a lot better than having fixed limitations that we historically have had to live with. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Gray Powell Q Analyst, BTIG LLC Got it. Thank you very much. I'll leave it there. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: Thank. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 11 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 Patrick Colville Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. It's not product – we only have one product and the product is not vertical, it's a horizontal product, it's an infrastructure platform. This is really about use cases. It's how you apply technology to industry-specific challenges and problems. As you said, it very much has to do with okay, what are specific institutions doing in specific industries with Snowflake and how can other entities in that industry [indiscernible] (29:59) industry take advantage of those learnings. There's a lot of talk going on inside these verticals between entities about hey what are the opportunities to apply these technologies to problems that we're all living with. So that's why verticalization is so important because we can really accelerate our business when these use cases and these opportunities are becoming more broadly shared. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Patrick Colville Q Senior Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah, Christian here. We look at a number of adoption metrics. All of them are following our more successful launches related to other previews we've done. We have talked to the different customers that have been earlier adopters of the technology and the feedback is overwhelmingly positive and as Frank mentioned in his remarks, we have over 50 partners that have signed up to drive solutions with Snowpark and they also have overwhelmingly positive feedback, but that will also provide leverage to the adoption, so we're highly confident. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Patrick Colville Q Operator: Thank you, your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Q Hi. Thank you for taking the question. This is [indiscernible] (31:35) for Keith, I had a question for Christian, it, sort of, relates to Snowflake and maybe the application market which is a $300 billion dollar market today. As customers are, sort of, centralizing more and more of your data on to Snowflake, what are the potential 12 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 opportunities in terms of applications, development of applications on top of Snowflake maybe it's a next generation CRM or a next generation financials application, given that you're centralizing that data, what do you think that Snowflake's role could be when it comes to applications that something more – that partners would, sort of, build on top of or could we see Snowflake have some ambitions on the applications side of the house? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Christian Kleinerman A Senior Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. Good question here. It's a great question and obviously something that is an important priority for us, we shared some of this vision at our Investor Day. One of the biggest challenges that application developers face today is the notion of data governance where they need to get customers to trust them and share the data with them. What we are enabling is bringing those applications to operate within the governance and security perimeter of Snowflake and we see interest from applications across horizontals and verticals wanting to build on top of Snowflake and running closer to the data without creating copies or silos. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. One follow-up, this is Frank. One of the things that we talk about when we talk about the Data Cloud is that it is in a completely comprehensive hemisphere for application developers and I referenced this in the prepared remarks, what that means is, we have a Data Cloud that has number one, life data and number two, it has full blown infrastructure obviously that can scale unlimited as a function of our public cloud relationships. We have, through Snowpark, a complete application development infrastructure on top of that cloud. Then we have a marketplace that allows people to find, to discover, to explore, to try out applications and later monetization on top of that you have basically an environment where developers can build cloud applications that the world has never seen before and we sometimes compare this to what happened on mobile development which was obviously was a huge role. The mobile developers have to set up separate environments for iPhone and for Android. Here you literally have one place and you'll be able to target multiple runtime platforms in terms of AWS, Azure, GCP and so on. So that's really what the Data Cloud wanted fully built out and all its capabilities what it will be and so I think your question about software developers is strategically very important to Snowflake. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Q Yeah, [indiscernible] (34:32). As a follow-up, going into sort of Mike's commentary around the expansion opportunity within these larger customers, I know it's early in terms of the data marketplace, but is there any sort of example that you can cite in terms of customers standing up new revenue generating businesses whether it's data storage or data marketplace, monetizing that business and how that revenue that they're getting compares to their annual Snowflake spend, is that a multiple of 2, 5, 10, any sort of indicators from some of these early cohorts that are monetizing [indiscernible] (35:09) new businesses on Snowflake? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah, I think we – this is Frank, we have seen some of our data partners certainly in the financial verticals having in very short period of time, very substantial expansion of their business. We're literally a channel for them to reach demand that they couldn't through traditional challenges. I can't really bring any more sort of comparisons and metrics to it, it's probably something that we'll try to do at a future point in time. 13 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 But there is no doubt that, as I said during the prepared remarks, we have tremendous growth in the data listings that are coming on to the marketplace and by the way the reason that they're coming is because they're viewing Snowflake increasingly as a place where they can sell data and the network effect starts to be induced and more data begets more data, right, because it becomes a very rich environment after a while. So, we're very positive with this quarter, with the growth in listings, the growth in data edges and so on and that's really how we track our progress in terms of the Data Cloud and the data networking relationships that make up that Data Cloud. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Q [ph] Appreciate that. Thanks for taking the questions (36:33). ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: Thank you, your next question comes from the line of Kamil Mielczarek of William Blair. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Kamil Mielczarek Q Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Hi, everyone, congrats on a strong quarter and thank you for taking my questions. I believe you mentioned in your prepared remarks that tech and financial services were first drivers of your strength and at your User Conference you called out media and entertainment as your largest vertical, so it's great to see the broad growth. As you look across the six end markets that you've structured your sales force around, are there any industries that particularly stand out as drivers of strength over the next one to two years, especially as the economy opens up and where do you see the risks of deceleration, particularly as you think about your guidance? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Well, it's Frank, you're correct, both media and entertainment, that area is approximately the same order of magnitude [ph] of financial services, both drivers (37:33) of our business. I really don't see any deceleration risk. We're just waiting for industries that were heavily affected by the pandemic to come online, obviously, hospitality, aviation, all the places that have suffered disproportionately to start normalizing and will become, I guess more daring in terms of their exploits with us. And so I see that as a upside, but one of the great things about the type of business that we're in, it's very secular in the sense that it's really not driven by too many macro factors. I mean, this is something that people are going to do, just some of them are just doing it faster than others. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Kamil Mielczarek Q Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Yeah, makes sense. And just as a quick follow-up, can you talk about any changes you've seen on the competitor front? Are you seeing any private companies more often among your large public competitors, are you seeing any impact from the changes they're making to their platforms? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. 14 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 Not really. The competitive environment has been speculated upon quite a bit in recent days and weeks, but from our perspective, things are the same. Obviously, when you become a much bigger company as we have been, the intensity starts to pick up because you're just in more places and you're contesting in more places and so on. But fundamentally the dynamic is as we have characterized it previously. So there's really nothing terribly noteworthy in that area. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Kamil Mielczarek Q Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC All right, that's good to hear. Thanks Frank and congrats again. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Raimo Lenschow Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. I haven't seen any real change in contract durations. Still the majority of our customers start with a one year contract and then on the renewal they do a multiyear contract. We did see our ACV pick up, but in terms of deal size, it's actually remained pretty consistent there. I will say there're some new customers we're in discussions with that are willing to do bigger deals, first year deal, but they're one year deals with them, but I don't think that's going to change the ramp time to any of these customers historically. They just take 9 to 12 months to really ramp a large customer. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Raimo Lenschow Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yes. It's not entirely the wrong discussions to have. I mean, both these dynamics are playing out at the same time. There's tons of discussion going on in terms of legacy replacements. You mentioned Teradata, the reality of the Teradata world is, it's not that easy to pick up that [ph] workload and move it (41:34), it costs a lot of money and I think Teradata has done a good job making it bloody hard to move off their platform. Kudos to them, but we're still up 30% year-on-year in terms of Teradata replacements. 15 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 So that will play itself out over time. Is it going to happen? Is it going to go faster [indiscernible] (41:58) it is going to happen. It's not going to stay, but you are also correct that those are traditional data warehousing workloads, and obviously we're the king of doing that sort of thing, but as I commented earlier we're busting out in all these verticals, and all these new use cases that are going way beyond data warehousing. The Data Cloud is the evolution of the data warehouse. That is the way to think about it, right? It is an incredibly enhanced vision of what data warehousing was, right? So that's where our people want to go. They don't want to replicate the data warehousing legacy in the cloud. That is a missed opportunity, and that's why there is so much new energy, and new dynamics going on, because of what is now possible that wasn't before. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. I'll also add, Raimo, too, it's not just Teradata, there's piles of Hadoop on-prem Cloudera that we are doing and we're in discussions with many customers who still have multiple years left on those contracts, but they're all in discussions to move to Snowflake. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Raimo Lenschow Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. It's going to take a number of years. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Raimo Lenschow Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Thanks. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: Your next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... David Hynes Q Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC Hey guys. A great set of numbers here. Mike the net revenue expansion metrics stand out and continue to impress. I'm just curious as the base ages, are there any consistent signals that this expansion starts to plateau, or normalize either at a certain time period, or a spend threshold. I don't know if there's cohort data that you can share. I'm just trying to think about how this plays out longer term as the business matures? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. 16 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 Obviously longer term, it will come down as our customer base becomes larger. I think we've only been selling product for what five years now, six years, and I remember this is going back two years. Looking at it, I don't see any real slowdown in the near term future, but definitely over time that number will come down. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... David Hynes Q Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC Okay. And then Frank, one for you. As you continue to introduce new solutions, features, functionality, will they always be aimed at driving incremental consumption, or do you see Snowflake ever introducing additional non- consumption based SKUs that could add different layers to the revenue model? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Well we obviously are very focused because when you look at the world through a lens of consumption, that is true. That's how we seek alignment, but one area that comes to mind that is not consumption based is through the monetization models that we are developing for data and data applications, so that that will also drive consumption, but it will also have transactional component that will be a truly business model than consumption. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... David Hynes Q Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC Yeah right. Okay. Thank you guys. Congrats. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... J. Derrick Wood Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Well obviously we have large customers like Instacart, who obviously have revolutionized retail and obviously they have a very important relationship with the large retailers all over the place. The use of Snowflake there affords them all kinds of new opportunities for insights and for optimization, so retail is hot. It's really the combination of retail with the CPGs, the consumer packaged goods providers, the amount of data that is moving back, and forth between these entities, and the insights that can now be derived, and how much faster these insights are being derived. So in retail it's certainly the type of business that has to come a long way in terms of sophistication. It used to be – it was very difficult for them to have accurate inventory levels and really know where to restock, and how to restock, and things like Instacart have really helped because they run [ph] catalogues (46:56) across all these stores to know exactly what's there, what's not there, and that's sort of the new value that's that brought in terms of data to these verticals. 17 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 I can on and on about one vertical after another in terms of what's going on there. I remember having a conversation with the Chief Science Officer of a big pharma and they were saying that they viewed the biggest impact in the world of life sciences in terms of people's longevity and quality of life. It will come from data science and will not come from life science, which are really enormous statements to come out of life science companies. They think that the enrichment of data is going to create insights in terms of the effectiveness of treatments and therapies and protocols, and so on, that they are going to have an enormous effect. So that why you see data becoming insanely important to all these different verticals because of the impact that it's going to have on what people do for a living. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... J. Derrick Wood Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. I don't think it's going to go up. I think we're going to do above 160% for the balance of the year, what I said last quarter. And our large customers just continue to increase their consumption. When I look at the forecast for this quarter, our largest customers are continuing to consume at a very rapid pace. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... J. Derrick Wood Q Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Church from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Dan Church Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Sure. Let me go first Mike and you can go second on the second part of the question. It is really hard to predict where the ship is going to hit the beach, because it's so dynamic. There is so much latent pent-up demand. There's so much opportunity. So it's really not that helpful to look at historical spend and try to extrapolate that into the future. 18 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 And you see that in our net revenue retention rate, it is strictly – the fact that it's now possible that we're enabling that demand is why it's happening, right. So can we foretell exactly what that's going to be? No we can't. We're just going to follow it to where it leads and we're going to enable it to the maximum extent, but I can put a stick in the ground and say this is what it will be. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. On your question, the Fortune 500 – I just want to remind people, Fortune 500 is very much a US-centric term and the Fortune 500 account for roughly 25% of our $1 million plus customers. We have a number of Global 2000. We've started looking at Global 2000. I think we now have 462 of the Global 2000. We'll start reporting on that next year. But, clearly large customers are what are driving that $1 million, there's a lot in our Fortune 500 that are large customers. And we think that will continue to be the case. Yes, the Fortune 500s have big wallets. And those will be some of our largest customers and we think that will continue to be the case. In terms of your net revenue retention, I'm not going to guide long-term, it's hard to do that, I'm just going to reiterate again what I said to Derrick is we will stay above 160% for this year and I do expect longer term as our customer base gets bigger and bigger and more mature, that number will come down, but I still think it'll be well above 130%, 140% for a very long time. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Dan Church Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Well, we saw it right now and I'm not expecting a big increase in – as a reminder, we do new storage compression technology every two years. We just rolled that one out last quarter. Storage is running just under 10% of our total revenue and so clearly compute is what's driving the margin now. And we think with data sharing it will be a higher percentage of compute going forward. I don't expect it to see much improvement on the storage side. The biggest driver though of gross margin is as we move into larger customers that are buying enterprise and business critical that is more software rich, that drives the gross margin. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Dan Church Q Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 19 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Aug-2021 Joe Goodwin Q Analyst, JMP Securities LLC Hi this is Joe on for Pat. Great to see the strength in the Asia Pacific region, what point would it make sense to expand your cloud in the region like Alibaba Cloud, I guess what's the thought process there, any color would be great? Thank you. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. Let me just say, first of, we have made a decision as a company that we need to move into China, that's because China is now integral to the world economy, it's not a separate market and our largest customers are demanding and insisting that we be there and we're literally in the middle of figuring out how to be there and we're evaluating all those options. Whether we are in one flavor of the cloud or another, it depends a whole lot on what type of a dynamic we're anticipating. We've learned a whole bunch from being with Amazon, being with Microsoft and being with Google and we're certainly going to take those learnings into that markets as well. Christian anything you want to add to that? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Christian Kleinerman A Senior Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc. I would add that we like meeting customers where they are and they guide very much our deployment in regional as well as cloud deployments. As Frank said, yes, we want to go in China and it's working with our customers that we determine how we do that. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Joe Goodwin Q Analyst, JMP Securities LLC Thank you. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
