We saw momentum accelerate in Q3 with product revenues growing 110% year-on-year to $312 million, and remaining performance obligations growing to $1.8 billion. The net 3 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 revenue retention rate expanded to 173%, and we recorded our first positive non-GAAP operating income in the company's history. Our Q3 Fortune 500 customer count totaled 223, increasing by eight in the quarter, and we now have 148 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million. Our growth is driven by a diverse mix of customers. The 10 largest consumers in Q3 include four Fortune 500 companies, four companies less than 10 years old, and a Powered by Snowflake program partner. We continued our international expansion with product revenue from EMEA and Asia Pacific outstripping the company's year-on-year growth, up 174% and 290%, respectively. We have recently launched operations in three new countries, Israel, Korea and the United Arab Emirates. Vertical industry focus is an important evolution of our selling motion, especially in global enterprise accounts. During the quarter, we announced two industry Data Clouds. The financial services Data Cloud brings together the Snowflake platform, partner solutions and industry data to help financial services organizations mobilize their data. Customers can launch products, build fintech platforms, and accelerate their compliance on top of Snowflake. Industry-leading customers are Allianz, BlackRock, Capital One, New York Stock Exchange, Refinitiv, Square, State Street, and Western Union are all part of the financial services Data Cloud. We also launched the Media Data Cloud which enables media and advertising companies to share data for audience insights and measurements. With data clean rooms enabled by Snowflake, advertisers, agencies and publishers can design their own collaborative environments. The Media Data Cloud includes industry leaders like Disney Advertising Sales, Xperian, Horizon Media, and The Trade Desk. We're teaming up the Disney Advertising Sales to provide the infrastructure underlying their new data clean room solution. Together, Snowflake and Disney advertising sales enable data collaboration for compliant and secure advertising. We launched our Powered by Snowflake program in June to help companies build and promote applications in the Data Cloud. Powered by Snowflake is designed to accelerate the delivery of cloud applications on Snowflake. To date, there are over 175 Powered by Snowflake companies who have access to technical resources to design their applications. Most recently, we announced Securonix, UiPath, VideoAmp and ZoomInfo as Powered by Snowflake partners. In October, we held the Snowflake BUILD Summit, which focuses on software developers, data scientists and data engineers. The event received over 20,000 registrations, which was three times last year's build events. Attendees got a closer look at new applications leveraging Snowpark, which brings programmability to Snowflake and is in public preview. Developers explored how new Java user-defined functions are expanding what is possible with Snowflake. Updates to the Snowpark Accelerated program were also announced and built. Snowpark accelerated provides partners with access to technical experts and market exposure to Snowflake customers. Snowpark provides programming language choice to Snowflake's Data Cloud. Customers can access prebuild partner capabilities and integrations. It is leveraged by companies such as DataIQ, DataRobot and H2O.ai. At our recent Snow Day event with more than 23,000 registrations, we announced that our customers can now use Python natively within Snowflake. With Snowpark for Python, developers will be able to easily program with a widely popular language. They can also leverage the security governance or performance of Snowflake. Snowpark for Python is currently in private preview. During the quarter, Snowflake invested in Anaconda to bring enterprise-grade Python capabilities to the Data Cloud. Together, we enable the Python community to build 4 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 secure data pipelines and machine learning capabilities. The Anaconda partnership will enhance the Snowpark experience to extend programmability with Snowflake. Last year, we issued our first startup challenge. 700 companies from 56 countries competed to build a data application with Snowflake. We announced our second Snowflake startup challenge and build with an opportunity for up to $1 million in total investment. Snowflake's data marketplace grew 41% this quarter, now with more than 900 data sets from over 200 providers. We also saw more than 130% annual increase in so-called stable edges. Stable edges are ongoing Snowflake data networking relationships between providers and consumers. One of the featured data sets is FactSet's Tick History DataFeed. It provides asset managers real-time data from over 200 exchanges. ZoomInfo is another feature data set. It provides company and contact data with no additional integration or ETL required. The overarching backdrop for Snowflake is the inexorable march towards direct-to-consumer operations and full- blown digital transformation. Enterprises and institutions have grown acutely aware how much they will end up relying on data operations, data analytics and data science. Data is becoming the beating heart of the modern enterprise. So the race is on to lay the foundation for a digital, data-driven infrastructure. Snowflake is and will be a critical enabler of this journey. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Thank you, Frank. Q3 was a breakout consumption in bookings quarter for us. Our Q3 product revenues were $312 million, representing 110% year-over-year growth. Consumption continues to be led by our financial services, media, retail and technology customers. Our outperformance is fuelled by our existing customer base, which is demonstrated by our net revenue retention rate of 173%. Net revenue retention expansion is driven by rapid growth among our largest customers and the addition of six customers to the measurement cohort that have gained greater than $1 million of revenue in the past year. In Q3, 5 of our top 10 customers grew at or above the company's product revenue growth rate of 110% year-on-year. Q3 benefited from record quarter-on-quarter incremental growth, and we are pleased to see our largest customers continuing to expand their use of Snowflake. Q3 was also an impressive quarter of sales execution. Remaining performance obligations grew to $1.8 billion with our key industry's leading net new bookings. We're also pleased with our progress to mature the sales motion to sell large, multi-year deals. In the quarter, we signed a three-year $100 million deal to an existing customer as well as five additional eight-figure multi-year deals. These commitments signal organizations' intent to expand their use of Snowflake and we look forward to seeing our consumption follow-up. Of the $1.8 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. We remain focused on penetrating the largest enterprises globally as we believe these organizations provide the largest opportunity for account expansion. In Q3, the number of customers with greater than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased to 148, up from 116 last quarter including eight consuming more than $10 million. 5 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 Q3 was also highlighted by meaningful strides in our partner ecosystem. First, our relationships with our cloud service providers in the field continue to strengthen. This fiscal year-to-date, we have co-sold over $0.5 billion in total contract value with our cloud service providers. Second, we are seeing significant growth from our Powered by Snowflake program with the number registered powered by partners growing 137% quarter-on-quarter and the product revenue from those partners growing 173% year-on-year. Lastly, we are seeing growing engagement within the Data Cloud ecosystem and we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to invest through Snowflake Ventures. In the quarter, we announced strategic investments in Anaconda, OverlayAnalytics and [ph] Roadwing (11:35). The third quarter also saw meaningful gains in profitability and efficiency. On a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 74.6% scale, larger mix of compute consumption and increased price for credit related to greater consumption of higher price products additions drove the outperformance. Operating margin was 2.5%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and a portion of planned Q3 head count now starting in Q4. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 6.4%, positively impacted by operating margin outperformance. As a reminder, adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of net cash paid or received on both employee and employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions. This quarter we saw a $12 million positive impact from those items. We maintained our strong cash position with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Now, let's turn to our guidance and outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $345 million and $350 million, representing year-over-year growth between 94% and 96%. Our forecast calls for our top customers to continue growing from Q3 to Q4, but not at the same record rate we saw from Q2 to Q3. Daily customer consumption patterns determine our revenue forecast. In many cases, consumption is driven by our customers' own business cycles and growth patterns. In Q4 of last year, some of our largest customers experienced tremendous business growth. With holiday travel returning to a more normal cadence, we also expect a greater impact on consumption in Q4 this year than last year. Turning to margins, we expect on a non-GAAP basis 1% operating margin, and we expect $358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As mentioned earlier, we pushed some hiring into Q4 but still expect to hire more than 1,200 employees in fiscal year 2022. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $1.126 billion and $1.131 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 103% and 104%. Turning to profitability for the full year, we expect on a non-GAAP basis 74% product gross margin, negative 4% operating margin, and 8% adjusted free cash flow margin. And we expect 357 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the remainder of the calendar year, we expect to remain in a predominantly remote work environment with limited travel. Our forecast reflects this plan while assuming an uptick of return to office expenses in the fourth quarter. While we anticipate an eventual return to the office, we do not have a specific timeline for that goal. With the Snowflake Ventures portfolio growing and strategic investments in privately held and publicly traded securities, please keep in mind that we may see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses going forward. We expect to recognize non-cash gains of approximately $20 million in the aggregate on prior strategic investments based on transactions that have closed so far in Q4. 6 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 And lastly, we will host our Investor Day in-person, the week of June 13 in conjunction with Snowflake Summit in Las Vegas. If you would like to attend, please e-mail IR@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. And as a reminder, Christian Kleinerman, our SVP of Products, will be joining us for Q&A. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have your first question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Excuse me, Raimo, your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Raimo Lenschow Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Raimo, it's Frank. Generally, we agree with what your assessment that we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Snowflake was built from the ground up as a data-sharing platform and we've been at it from the beginning, and you see a lot of other players following our lead in this regard. But we are in the beginning. What happens a lot in our field, in our business is that people look at modernizing legacy workloads and those kinds of things often have priority over getting to data sharing because we can't even consider data sharing unless we get our data to cloud where we start moving our workloads, we migrate our databases and so on. So, yeah, we're in the very early stages. But as you see from the metrics that we report on, there is a very, very steady, aggressive growth happening quarter-on-quarter, but we sort of haven't reached that tipping point yet where sort of the floodgates are open and things are just expanding at meteoric rate. But we're anticipating that that will happen at some point. It's very non-linear in the way the adoption is going to develop. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. And, Raimo, on your question on gross margins, I'm not giving guidance for next year or the longer term. We'll update that in June. All I will say is we still have a number of deployments around the world that are not at scale, which there is upside in our margins from that coupled with as we get into these larger customer relationships that are going with our higher addition product, they do attract higher margin. Consistent with what we said when we 7 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 were going public, I don't think this is ever going to get into the mid-80s like some of the other SaaS companies. But clearly, our longer term guidance was 75% and there is upside to that. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Raimo Lenschow Q Operator: We have your next question for Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Kirk Materne Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. Kirk, it's Frank. Yeah. You definitely see network effects not so much by an enterprise, by institution, but really by industry because the industry [indiscernible] (20:01), they there is really induce and invoke the network effect because the entities have relationships and do business together. So some of the Data Clouds that we announced during the quarter like the financial service Data Cloud and media and advertising, there is a huge amount of network effect in that area. Advertising for a lot of reasons that people know is under enormous pressures. There's this whole moment of foot to enrich data for advertising yield and effectiveness. When we're trying to enrich data that then triggers data sharing and data attribution-type of strategy, so it's very strong there. But there is a difference between industries. Some industries are very leading-edged, their leaning in very, very hard. Others just take longer and you also see by geography it's different as well. Europe and Asia are running whatever, 18, 24 months behind or so. But everybody is going to get there, some are just more upfront than others. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. And, Kirk, on your question on hiring, I want to start by saying we're all about quality rather than quantity of people and so we're very selective. We are slightly behind but we're more than making that up this quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect to hire net 1,200 people this year. And we're happy with the people we're hiring but we will not sacrifice quality over quantity. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Kirk Materne Q Operator: We have your next question from Derrick Wood with Cowen. Your line is open. 8 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 J. Derrick Wood Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. What I would say is it was really driven by some of our largest, mature customers with some things that was unique to their business that kind of surprised us on the upside. I don't think you're going to see that same repeat of a beat, at least I'm not expecting that. I'm sure you guys would love it, but I just don't see that happening in this quarter. As we said before, a 5% to 7% beat is a big beat for us with our model. So, it was exceptional performance last quarter. I'm actually disappointed we outperformed that much to be honest with you. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... J. Derrick Wood Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. [indiscernible] (22:51). ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... J. Derrick Wood Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. It's really rippling through the entire economy, right? I mean, you really got to sort of view this in the context of the whole world going direct-to-consumer, every industry is even people who have historically not been direct-to- consumer are moving towards direct-to-consumer and that obviously triggers enormous investments and people trying to get up to speed on data operation, data science and being able to run a real data-driven enterprise. In order to do that, we need to have very, very, very refined data enrichment strategies to really tune and optimize and make these relationships work. And that's what's fuelling this enormous focus on data sharing and being able – people being able to enrich their data with attributes that come from other sources. So, the ability to own your data as an institution, as an enterprise and to fully operationalize or mobilize is going to become incredibly important. I mean, even industries that historically have not been direct-to-consumer I think of retail and things of that sort retail obviously in the brick-and-mortar type, they're all changing now under the influence of the likes of Instacart and DoorDash. So, it's all changing, so the interaction method becoming digital is a real tailwind for companies like Snowflake. 9 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 J. Derrick Wood Q Operator: We have your next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Kash Rangan Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. Kash, I agree with your statement. I mean, we are – we have footprint but we're very marginally penetrated which is great. That's exactly what we look for. We typically – when we start out with customers whether it's Fortune 500 or otherwise, the whole process that spans a long period of time, it's a journey, it's a relationship that you're going. There are legacy workloads, there are new projects and it's something that grows and grows and grows. And you very clearly see that in our net revenue retention rates that people are literally evolving and learning and expanding as they go along. They might not have a very clear view of what they will be doing or when, but they are literally learning and exploring as they go along. The other thing that I would say is that we shouldn't sort of view things in the historical way that all the money is going to come from Fortune 500 companies. This is absolutely not the case. I mean, you'll be stunned if you look at the number of customers that – who are not Fortune 500 and how high their revenue contribution is and that's because these are newer enterprises, they are born in the cloud, digital direct-to-consumer-oriented and they have a very different culture towards data and a very different orientation. They will definitely feature very, very prominently in our business mix, doesn't mean that Fortune 500 isn't important, obviously, is but their adoption as traditional enterprises is often not as fast as the newer entities that we're dealing with. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Kash Rangan Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. We will be updating our long-term guidance at our Investor Day. I clearly do think there is upside to both of our operating margin and free cash flow margin and we will update it at that time. 10 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 Kash Rangan Q Operator: We have your next question from DJ Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... David Hynes Q Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC Hey. Thanks, guys, and congrats on the results, really impressive. Again, like the stand-ups you made at the net revenue retention, so, Frank, I guess the question is, as you think about driving growth in the base, where does the discovery of new use cases typically come from? Is it mostly customer-led, how much can sales influence that expansion process? And I guess like longer term, do you think you have to build out a customer success layer over time? I would love to just get your thoughts as you think about how this evolves over time. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Well, first off, the entire company is a customer success layer, okay? That is not a department or a function in our world. There are some predictable ways in which things happen but it depends on the type of enterprises that we deal with. Historically, we've worked on legacy workloads, on-premise workloads and we have a very predictable pattern moving data to the cloud and migrating databases, that is a tried and true part of our business. Others, and this is the reason why verticalization is such an important trend, is that has very little to do with legacy workloads. It has everything to do with preparing companies for their digital direct-to-consumer futures where they're trying to really mobilize data, monetize data and make data really the core of what they're doing. And that is not just in – those are not just in enterprises that you would typically think of, but even in enterprises like in retail that are traditionally brick-and-mortar, they become very, very focused on their data, on the data that they have, the value that it has and how they monetize that. So, these are very, very big things that they're having. Everybody is realizing they're sitting on something extraordinarily valuable, if they can enrich it and mobilize it in the right way. So, demand comes from many different places, the sales organizations, over the last year, are being redirected to really understand the customers' context. What are their challenges, what are people doing, what are people not doing, how are they approaching it so that we can bring that value to our customer. So it's no longer, hey, here's our architecture versus the next guy, lets benchmark and POC this workload, see how they do, that's was historically what Snowflake did. Now, we're completely leaned into to the customers' context, what are their issues, their challenges and we are becoming expert at their business, and that is a big evolution. It's very exciting because it also elevates us inside the enterprise. We're no longer talking exclusively to IT types and CIOs and so on, but we're not talking to the business side of IT which is very different conversation. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... David Hynes Q Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. It's helpful color. And then, Mike, as a follow-up, so you made some comments with respect to how you're thinking about Q4 consumption patterns and it made me think about complexities in forecasting a business like this. So, I guess the question really is like, do you find that it's getting easier or harder to model the business as it scales? I mean, I feel like on the one hand you probably benefit from customer diversity and additional data points around usage patterns, but on the other, you're constantly trying to figure out 11 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 kind of the patterns of new customers. So, clearly, some puts and takes there. Would just love to get your thoughts. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. I think it's getting better and I've been very happy. And I think the Q3 performance relative to our internal forecast is specific to some very large customers. Other than that, we've been pretty accurate with what we gave the field at the beginning of the year consumption by customer, our forecast. So, I'm pretty pleased with that and it does get easier as we have a larger and larger customer base. And the beautiful thing is we use Snowflake to help in our modelling. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... David Hynes Q Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC The proof is in the pudding. Thank you, guys. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: We have your next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Mark R. Murphy Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. When I look at the outperformance across our company, the outperformance is really being driven by a number of large customers whose businesses are growing dramatically plus a couple of our Fortune 500 customers that are doing some specific things is really what's driving it. So, I can't say it has anything to do with the pandemic, supply chain, pharma, looking at things based upon the customers that I see that have the really large outperformance. That doesn't mean there's not any of them in our customer base but I just don't see that as the biggest drivers of our outperformance. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Mark R. Murphy Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Well, if you recall at the end of last quarter, a lot of people picked on our RPO and I said, don't worry it's timing, and Q3 was going to have a big quarter of RPO, which we pretty much hit our target internally as to where we 12 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 thought it would be. There is timing. As an example, our first $100 million deal we did in 2020, clearly, that customer is not renewing every year because it's in RPO. We will do some big deals this quarter too. I expect Q4 is going to be a big RPO addition. But, at the end of the day, it's not RPO in isolation, it's revenue and its more current RPO that is more meaningful. And that's how we give you that 55% we estimate will be recognized over the next 12 months. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Mark R. Murphy Q Operator: We have your next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Gregg Moskowitz Q Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC All right. Thank you. Congrats on the terrific quarter. So, we've been hearing more customer anecdotes to the tune of, as these companies are growing, they're becoming less confident that other solutions they may be using for data warehousing, et cetera, can handle their future data volumes and performance needs and that in turn is driving more business to the Snowflake platform. Is that consistent, Frank, with what you're seeing? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Generally, I would say yes. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Gregg Moskowitz Q Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC All right. That's short and sweet. And then just as a follow-up, so I wanted to ask about international because the revenue growth that you reported this quarter was pretty stunning. Clearly, that was a primary driver of the product revenue acceleration you showed this quarter. The question here is, are you seeing signs of an inflection in consumption overseas or was this more driven by consumption from a few of those larger customers that surprised you this quarter? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. What I would say, first of all, is we saw real outperformance relative to plan in bookings in Asia and EMEA. We also had a very, very strong North America, but off a much higher plan. Yes, in our top 10, we have one European customer that is our largest and is growing very, very fast. But still the majority of our growth in revenue is coming from our North American customers. But we do see next year and beyond EMEA in particular and Asia starting to drive some of that as well too. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Gregg Moskowitz Q Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC That's helpful. Thank you. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: We have your next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 13 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 Brad Zelnick Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. So, first of all, I think it's going well with some of the CSPs. And of that, and as I said, it was over $0.5 billion today that we co-sold with them. I would say AWS is the majority of that followed by Microsoft. Google is pretty much zero in that co-sell. But we still are adding more and more our number of customers in GCP continues to increase. And sorry, Brad, what was the other part of your question? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brad Zelnick Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. So, some customers choose to go through marketplace, others choose to go direct. They generally choose to go to marketplace so they can drive down their commit with the cloud provider. That would still show up in RPO because we still get the contract from the customer. We just do the invoicing and everything through marketplace for them. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brad Zelnick Q Senior Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc. Yes. So, hi, Brad. Christian here. I think that at all points in time in Snowflake we're investing in performance. Every part of the system is getting faster, lower latency, but [indiscernible] (39:23) price performance of customer workloads. Many of us at Snowflake have been in the industry long enough to know that the TPC Benchmarks end up being [indiscernible] (39:33) synthetic evaluations that very quickly get divorced from customer benefits. And at Snowflake, we're 100% focused on price performance for our customers, but it's not just price performance, it's everything else. It's the collaboration and the data sharing that was mentioned, as well as the data governance. That's how we think about the broader Data Cloud. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 14 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 Brad Zelnick Q Operator: We have your next question from Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Kamil Mielczarek Q Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Hi, everyone. Congrats on another incredible quarter, and thanks for taking my question. So, I have a follow-up from the comments you made on the Fortune 500 customers. So, now, close to half of them – close to half of the Fortune 500 customers today, but only about 15% of them are generating $1 million or more on revenue. So, is it a fair expectation that most of them can reach and exceed that $1 million level in next two years? And secondly, you said that it takes about nine months for your customers to reach that contractually targeted revenue. For your $1 million customers, how long do it take, on average, for them to move from that contract signing to that $1 million? And given you're landing larger customers now, do you expect that duration to come down over time? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Well, it depends on the customer. Most customers don't sign a $1 million capacity one deal. They typically will sign – I think, if you look at our average deal size is somewhere around $50,000 initially signing a customer, and so clearly it takes some time. Yes, we sign some large customers in cap ones, but on average, it's not. We think, on average, when we laid out our model at our Analyst Day last year that we think we can get to our customers paying us over $1 million a year. On average, that will be $5.5 million. Right now, that 148 customers on average is $3.5 million. Clearly, the fact that we have 223 Fortune 500, those are only, on average right now, doing $1.250. There's a lot of upside in those numbers because it takes time to ramp these guys, and those have been added in the last couple of years and it will take time. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Kamil Mielczarek Q Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC That's great color. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, it's nice to see the positive operating income. We've talked in the past about Snowflake being in growth mode. So, given now you've broken even, can you update us on how you're thinking about balancing margin expansion versus reinvesting in the business? And specifically, your head count growth is roughly in line with last year. Can we see that accelerate if your margin starts to expand faster than expected? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Operator: We have your next question from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brent A. Bracelin Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Well, our overachievement is partially driven by these large customers. We did see, generally across the board, most of our customers have been exceeding their targets. Yes, there are some that are down, that happen every quarter, but there's a lot more that were above their forecast. So, it's hard to say, Brent, but yes, I do think we still would have – if I pulled out a couple of those big customers with their growth, we still would have been over 100% growth. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brent A. Bracelin Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. No, it was – we really don't have – we have one product brand. I said product edition. So, we have – if you recall, we have Standard, Enterprise, Business Critical, and yes, we have Virtual Private Snowflake too, but not as many customers use that because they're comfortable from a security going with Business Critical, and it's more of our larger customers using Enterprise or Business Critical that drive margin, and those editions have more features associated with them. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brent A. Bracelin Q Operator: We have your next question from Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Tyler Radke Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. One of the customers I know does a big project every year at that time of the year and it seemed to have consumed more. The others, I just don't expect them to grow. They're still going to grow their consumption, but I don't think they're going to grow their consumption at the same rate, and a lot of that is because we are seeing and we did see over the Thanksgiving holiday more people take vacation and at our customers, which does have an impact on their business and how they use Snowflake. And we do expect, over Christmas and New Year's, there's going to be more people as well, taking more vacation, and we do recognize revenue on a daily basis. And we do see dips in our customer consumption on those days. This is the highest holiday quarter of any quarter. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Tyler Radke Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Well, I mean, there are verticals like, for example, we talked about this on previous calls, the contribution we're getting from public sector is not where we think it will eventually be, and there's real structural reasons why that is so, and we're solving for those issues, and that business will come along. But there is a lot of friction. I mean, we're dealing with infrastructure that has existed for a very long period of time. It is completely grafted into operational processes. You don't just unplug that stuff and plug something new in and you're off to the races. But these are generational shifts and transitions that enterprises are taking. So, it's not like throwing the switch. These are very, very carefully orchestrated transitions over a long period of time. It takes a lot of resources, it takes a lot of people, and then once they sort of get to the other side, yeah, then you see the acceleration happening. We see that over and over again. And once they are re-platformed, then all of a sudden because of the nature of the Snowflake platform itself, sky is the limit because the platform is so accommodating of so many different workloads, and it just works. So, then the friction is – and we've gone from a lot of friction to almost no friction that sometimes to our customers [indiscernible] (48:23) because things are running away from them maybe little bit too quickly, and we help them with that. But that's really what Snowflake does. Once you get on the platform, the friction is very, very low to spitting up new workloads and new projects and new programs, and that's what you see us benefiting from. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Tyler Radke Q Operator: We have your next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Keith Weiss Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. I think it's a couple things. One, we talked about that when Frank came onboard pre going public, we really shifted to going after some of the largest companies in the world, not that we weren't going after them before, but I would say we more aggressively, the way we lined up our sales force, and it takes a number of years to ramp those customers, and we're seeing a lot of these companies starting to mature right now. Two, a lot of the things we've been doing with new product features like Snowpark and the Powered by, we're seeing the benefits of that take taking place, and not to mention the network effect with data sharing and other things that we're starting [indiscernible] (50:22) stable edges, it's kind of starting to come to fruition. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Verticalization. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Sorry. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Verticalization. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Verticalization is the other one too. That whole media cloud that is a huge thing for us, not to mention financial services cloud. I think we're getting much better, our sales people, at selling the business value into those verticals. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Keith Weiss Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. This is Frank. One of the great things about running a consumption model is that we charge back who is spending the compute, which business units. So, business units can decide where they want to run these workloads, how often they want to run it, how they want to position it. So, they're really in charge. It's not sort of a runaway utility model. People can selectively decide which workloads they want to run and what is the business case for them. That's the way it's supposed to work. That really mitigates the sticker shock which people can make investment decisions as they go along and [ph] as it learns it (52:08). We're seeing with some of our large banking customers, they went from recomputing loan rates on a monthly basis to doing it every night. Well, they had a business case for it. Does it cost money? Yes, it costs money. So, in other words, what's really happening is, in the beginning, people have sticker shock, yes, because they've bought those from x to 2x to 10x to whatever it is, and we're really resetting what is normal and what is appropriate spend for this class of computing. It is very different than what it historically has been because of, A, well, we're now capable of; and B, also the necessarily given the comments that we made earlier about the trend of direct-to-consumer and full-on digital transformation. You can choose to sit on your heels and wait it out, but I wouldn't recommend that. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. I will also add to is we really stress with customers to take training on how best practices around how to use Snowflake, how to optimize your queries, and we go into our largest customers. And I'll tell you, last quarter, one of our top 10 customers, we saw a big decrease in their consumption, more than what we are forecasting. Why? Because our RSAs went in there and helped optimize that customer. But you want to know what? When we do that, that customer then moves more workloads, and we're seeing this quarter already they're tracking ahead of our forecast because they're using in a more optimized way and the customer sees the value they're getting out of Snowflake, so. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Christian Kleinerman A Senior Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc. Let me add a quick comment. Also on the topic of performance, we are very intentional that each time we make the system faster, we're improving also the economics of Snowflake, and we hear very consistently from our customers that those are very welcome surprises where the economics of the platform are getting better without them having to do any upgrades or changes to the platform. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Keith Weiss Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Thanks. 19 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 Operator: We have your next question from Gray Powell with BTIG. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Janet Zhang Q Analyst, BTIG LLC Hi. This is Janet Zhang on for Gray Powell. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. So, I was wondering, what do you think is the best forward-looking predictor of revenue? I know last quarter there was a focus on RPO, which can move around. So, how much weight do you think we should put on things like RPO or customer adds versus just a pace of net new product revenue in a given quarter? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Michael P. Scarpelli A Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. No. I say the first thing is the guidance we give; the second thing is historical revenue growth patterns coupled with the current portion of RPO to build your models. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Janet Zhang Q Analyst, BTIG LLC Got it. That makes sense. Thank you so much. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: We have your next question from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Karl E. Keirstead Q Senior Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. Hi, Karl. The way we think about it is we want to help our customers bring the computation to do data science and machine learning on to Snowflakes so that they don't have to copy the data out and miss out on the benefits of data governance, et cetera. As such, the big investments we've done have been all around extensibility. That's where you see Snowpark, that's where you see Python. And we're partnering with all of the companies that you mentioned, for them to drive consumption and compute on Snowflake. So, we want this to have those solutions come and run natively on Snowflake. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Karl E. Keirstead Q Senior Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc. It's very large, yes. 20 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2021 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Snowflake, Inc. (SNOW) Corrected Transcript Q3 2022 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2021 Operator: We have your last question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brent Thill Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Thanks for the plug on the book there, Brent. I'm going to ask Christian to address this question. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Christian Kleinerman A Senior Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc. Yeah. So, unstructured data went into [indiscernible] (56:49) at our Snow Day. We are seeing quite a bit of adoption. We're seeing images, documents, even speech recordings getting stored into Snowflake. And we're seeing customers start to leverage Snowpark to do programming in Java to get value out of those files. So, it's looking pretty good from the early adoption, the few weeks that it has been in product review. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brent Thill Q Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc. I think healthcare is going to be a big one. I think, in the longer term, I do think public sector will be a big vertical we're working on. And retail is a very, very big vertical for us that we'll take on. Listen, we're doing well across the board. We're just really highlighting. We're doing exceptionally well in media and financial services. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Brent Thill Q Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Thanks, everyone. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: Assuming no further questions at this time, presenters, please continue. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Frank Slootman Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc. Yes.
